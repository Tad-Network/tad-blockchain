**How is this fork different?**

* We support both OG and NFT plots and get you **FULL** reward. Yes, that's right, **full reward for any type of plots.**
* Get most of the space on the hard drive - we support k28+ plots.  
* It's Open Source and forked off Chia Network 1.2.2. You can always audit code by diff'ing it with Chia upstream
* You don't need goddamn IP addresses for the nodes. Tad's network discovery works.
